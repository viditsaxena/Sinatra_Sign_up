### Sinatra App
- A "Sign-Up" application
- Use Backbone application consuming the API
- As a user, I can enter in my name, email, etc. so I can 'sign-up' to be contacted later.

Hey Dev!

As a musician, I want to have my laptop on my merch table...and future fans can walk up and sign-up! Make sense? They walk up...enter their name...email, etc!  

Here's the catch... I don't want them to be able to 'sign-up' unless the email address has `something@something.something`. Know what I mean?  Until those are all there...I want something RED (or something) telling the user they aren't done.  Once they have entered a real email...I want something GREEN (or something) telling the user they are ready to hit enter. My dev friend called this "Client-Side validation"?  

Thanks!
Mick
